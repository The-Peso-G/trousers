# Trousers ðŸ‘–
If Styled Components and class-names had a baby

[Try it here](link-to-storybook)

## Philosophy ðŸ¤”
- Let CSS do CSS
- Colocate css and js but don't intermingle them
- Avoid complex logic in CSS. Prefer modifiers based on predicates
- Avoid creating subcomponents just to attach styling. Css selectors should be enough
- Simplify testing. Classnames can be attached to dom and snapshot tested

## API

- `trousers.element`: Because the component is the block. And it is made up of elements
- `trousers.modifier`: Elements can be modified by props. This allows you to extend the look of the element, it also helps you seperate your JS logic from your CSS
